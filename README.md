This repository contains three projects. They all use the open source software openframeworks. The first project is ExcerciseAddons. This program uses the openframeworks addons ofxBox2d and ofxGui. This project uses the gui to allow the user to change the radii of the squares and circles they make. The second project is ExcerciseAnimation. This program makes a basic pong style game that two people can play at once. The third project is theFace. This program uses basic drawing features to draw the face of Rick Sanchez from the TV show "Rick and Morty". ExoPlanetaryNeighborhood uses the addons ofxCsv and ofxGui. This program reads data from a csv file that has information about exoplanets. This information comes from NASA's Kepler program. The information can be found at http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/discoveries/. This program prints out the planets a as far from the center as it is in parsecs from Earth. Each has a unique color based of of its temperature. When the user clicks on the planets their information gets printed to the console.
